# sourced because sourcing a file is executing it, and these run from whatever repo the human is in —
# so only what cannot move is here: a stub has to find the resolver before the resolver can decide
# anything. `ai/tools/resolve.sh` owns the rest, argv[0] included, and its header states why each line
# below is the shape it is — the `cd -P`, the one declared offset, the two guards, the exec.
